# NEW SECTION: Product & Build Services Positioning

*Added 2026-02-15. Working title — may iterate on naming.*

## Service One-liner
Product leader who ships code. Strategy through execution, powered by AI.

## Service Elevator Pitch (30 seconds, spoken)
> I've spent eight years leading product at companies like Porsche and fintech startups. Now I combine that product thinking with AI-native development tools to build apps and websites for clients — fast, high quality, and at a fraction of what a dev shop would charge. I'm not just a developer who codes or a consultant who advises — I do both. From strategy to shipped product.

## Service Positioning Statement

For startups, small businesses, and founders who need a product person who can also build, David Hamel offers Product & Build Services — combining senior product leadership (fractional CPO, strategy, roadmapping) with hands-on development of apps, websites, and landing pages using AI-native tooling. Unlike traditional dev agencies (expensive, slow, no product thinking) or freelance developers (no strategic perspective), David brings the full stack: product strategy, UX thinking, AND shipped code.

## Three Service Tiers

**1. Fractional CPO / Product Strategy**
For startups and scaleups that need senior product leadership without a full-time hire.
- Product strategy and roadmapping
- Team coaching and process design
- Technical architecture guidance
- Pricing: retainer-based, scoped per engagement

**2. App & Website Builds**
Full-service development of small apps, websites, and landing pages using AI-native tooling (Claude Code).
- Fast delivery (weeks, not months)
- High quality (modern stack: Astro, Next.js, React, Tailwind)
- Productized pricing: one-time build fee + optional monthly retainer
- Retainer covers: hosting management, content updates, minor features, analytics
- Target: businesses that need a professional web presence or internal tool but don't want to hire a dev team

**3. Own Ventures (Portfolio)**
David's own products — demonstrates the "practitioner who builds" positioning:
- Alba Wealth (primary) — AI-powered financial planning
- Ziggma — portfolio management, 35k users, €10k MRR, €1.5bn linked assets
- DeRisk — institutional risk analytics (NBIM/Barings/CCLA, >€1.5tn AUM)
- Digital Partners, Rootlocaly

## Differentiators for Build Services

- **Product + Code in one person** — most developers lack product thinking, most PMs can't ship code
- **AI-native development** — uses Claude Code for 3-5x faster delivery than traditional development
- **Transparent pricing** — fixed build fee, clear monthly retainer, no scope creep surprises
- **Ongoing relationship** — not a hit-and-run build; monthly retainer keeps the product evolving
- **Portfolio proof** — David builds his own products (Alba, Ziggma), not just client work

## Voice Adjustment for Build Services Content

Same core voice (direct, analytical, personal, accessible) but with a slightly more **technical and confident** tone when discussing product and build work:

**Example:**
Generic developer copy: "We build custom websites tailored to your business needs using the latest technologies."

David's tone: "I spent 8 years building products for Porsche and fintech startups. Now I use AI tools to build apps and websites in weeks instead of months — and I bring the product thinking that most developers skip."

# UPDATE: Positioning Statement (revised)

Previous: Two tracks (financial coaching + product/venture consulting)

Updated: Two tracks (financial coaching + Product & Build Services)

**For** English-speaking professionals in Germany who earn well but feel lost navigating the German financial system, AND for startups/founders who need a product person who can also build — David Hamel is an independent financial planning coach, product leader, and AI-native builder who combines personal coaching with hands-on product delivery. Unlike traditional advisors (commission-based, conflicted) or traditional dev shops (expensive, slow, no product thinking), David brings product leadership experience (Porsche, NBIM, Barings), fintech expertise (Ziggma, Alba Wealth), and genuine expat perspective from 15+ countries.

# UPDATE: Brand One-liner Options

Original: "Independent financial planning coach and fintech builder helping expats in Germany take control of their money."

Additional options reflecting expanded positioning:
1. "Financial planning coach. Product leader. Builder." (shortest, broadest)
2. "Independent financial planning coach and product builder helping expats and startups do more with less." (bridges both tracks)
3. Keep original for coaching-focused contexts, use "Product leader and AI-native builder. From strategy to shipped code." for build-focused contexts.

- Product strategy and venture building (existing)
