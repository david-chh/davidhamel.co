## Current State

**Status**: Phase 1 Foundation COMPLETE. Integrations done. Strategic positioning rethink in progress.
**Focus**: Decide whether to merge Product + Build into one page.

## Open Decision: Merge Product + Build?

David is leaning toward merging `/product` and `/build` into a single service page. Key reasoning:

**Why merge:**
- Product management is evolving — virtually all PMs can now vibe code. "PM who can also build" is table stakes, not a differentiator.
- Having separate pages dilutes both: Product page doesn't mention building. Build page undersells product/consulting experience.
- The actual service IS the combination — one person who does research, strategy, design, code, and deployment.

**The real differentiator (not "PM who codes"):**
- **Scale:** 30+ client projects scoped and delivered at Digital Partners. Not one or two — dozens.
- **Founder experience:** 4 ventures. Understands business outcomes, not just product.
- **Domain depth:** Financial services across Ziggma, DeRisk, Alba, Impactive.
- **Judgment first:** 8 years of product leadership BEFORE AI made building fast.
- **Pitch:** "I'm a one-person product and engineering team. I've done this 30+ times."

**Open questions:**
- URL: `/build`, `/services`, or `/work`?
- Homepage: three cards → two (Coaching + Product & Build)?
- Page structure for the merged page
- How to frame it when PM+code is no longer unique

## David's 6 Strategic Goals

1. Freelance jobs for immediate cash flow
2. Financial coaching clients for immediate cash flow
3. Build out Alba Wealth as standalone product
4. Build out Rootlocaly as social network (skip for now)
5. Blog for international recognition in fiscal/monetary economics
6. AI-develop solutions for clients (retainer, financial services focus)

## Completed Work (Session 12 — 2026-02-21)

- Build page copy overhaul: new hero, removed sections, updated "Why this works" cards
