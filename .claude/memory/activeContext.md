## Current State

**Status**: Phase 1 Foundation COMPLETE. All pages built, integrations done. Build page copy polished. Strategic review completed — positioning changes pending.
**Focus**: Strategic positioning refinement.

## Completed Work (Session 12 — 2026-02-21)

### Build Page Copy Overhaul (EN + DE)
- Hero: "Leverage AI to build and experiment faster than ever"
- Subheading shortened to end at "integrating it operationally"
- Removed "Why This Matters Now" section entirely
- "Built for production" card → "Fraction of the cost of an agency"
- "One person, full context" → "Full context, fast iteration"
- Removed redundant lines from Scope and Build steps

### Strategic Review — Key Findings
- **Product + Build should be more connected**: David's unique value = product leader who can also ship code. Product page doesn't mention building. Build page undersells product experience.
- **Digital Partners consulting background undersold**: 30+ projects of scoping/discovery is the strongest proof for "I know WHAT to build"
- **Homepage serves two different audiences equally**: expats vs. startups/SMBs need different entry points
- **Blog needs content**: can't achieve recognition without posts
- **Rootlocaly identity unclear**: portfolio piece vs. real venture

## David's 6 Strategic Goals

1. Freelance jobs for immediate cash flow
2. Financial coaching clients for immediate cash flow
3. Build out Alba Wealth as standalone product
4. Build out Rootlocaly as social network
5. Blog for international recognition in fiscal/monetary economics
6. AI development solutions for clients (retainer, financial services focus)

## Key Differentiation Insight

David's AI-building capabilities should flow into the product lead positioning. As a freelancer, he can do what a 5+ person dev team could do. His Digital Partners consulting background (30+ projects, user research, business analysis) justifies his capabilities as an AI-builder who excels at figuring out WHAT to build.

## Priority Next Actions

1. Add building capability mention to Product page (quick win)
2. Rewrite Build page "Why this works" around consulting/scoping angle
3. Rethink homepage as two audience tracks (expats vs. startups/SMBs)
4. Publish 2-3 real blog posts for authority signal
5. Decide Rootlocaly's identity (portfolio piece or real venture)
