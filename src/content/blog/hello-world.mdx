## Why I'm writing

I've spent the last eight years building products — fintech platforms, IoT consulting practices, portfolio management tools, and now an AI-powered financial planning platform. Along the way, I've moved across 15+ countries and lived the expat life firsthand.

This blog is where I share what I've learned. It'll cover three themes:

1. **Expat finance** — navigating the German financial system, understanding taxes and insurance, and making smarter money decisions as an international professional.
2. **Product building** — lessons from founding companies, leading product teams, and shipping software with AI-native tools.
3. **Designing your life** — the intersection of financial planning and lifestyle design. How to build a life that works on your own terms.

## What to expect

I write for people who are smart, curious, and want practical advice — not theory. If you're an expat trying to figure out German taxes, a founder wondering how to ship faster, or anyone thinking about what financial freedom actually means, this blog is for you.

No fluff. No sales pitches. Just honest thinking from someone who's been in the trenches.

Welcome aboard.
