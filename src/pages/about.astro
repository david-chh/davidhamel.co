        <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-navy-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I grew up in a small town in northern Germany. It was a great place to
          be a kid — but I always knew there was a bigger world out there.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-navy-800 leading-relaxed">
          So as soon as I could, I left to find it.

  <SectionWrapper>
    <div class="max-w-[680px] mx-auto">
      <div class="font-serif text-lg leading-[1.8] text-navy-800">
        <p class="mb-6">
          I spent a year kitesurfing, surfing, and exploring — from Egypt to
          Brazil, Argentina to Fiji, Thailand to New Zealand. Traveling through
          so many countries showed me one thing clearly: international business,
          economics, and finance are the systems that shape our global world.
          Understanding how those systems work is what pulled me in — and what I
          decided to study.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          I studied International Business Administration at Rotterdam School of
          Management, graduated Cum Laude, then completed my MSc in Finance and
          Investments — with semesters at EDHEC in Nice and SMU in Singapore. After a stint in commodities trade finance at ABN Amro in
          Amsterdam, I knew I wanted to build things — not analyze them from a
          desk.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          So I started my first company. <a
            href="/projects/digital-partners"
            class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">Digital Partners</a
          > was a digital strategy and IoT consulting firm. Over six years, we
          executed 27 projects for industrial clients like Viessmann, Porsche,
          and Körber, building a team of seven engineers and three consulting
          partners across Berlin and San Francisco. During that time, I also took
          on product roles at <a
            href="/projects/porsche-digital-lab"
            class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">Porsche Digital Lab</a
          > — where I led a blockchain product for classic car provenance and
          helped secure €6.5M in funding — and at <a
            href="/projects/carly"
            class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">Carly</a
          > and <a
            href="/projects/buena"
            class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">Buena</a
          >, where I built sales funnels and automated contract workflows.
        </p>

        <Image

          class="rounded-2xl w-full my-10"
          widths={[680, 960, 1360]}
          sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"
        />

        <p class="mb-6">
          In late 2021, I joined Antler's Entrepreneur in Residence program in
          Berlin. That's where the idea for <a
            href="/projects/derisk"
            class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">DeRisk</a
          > crystallized — a platform for institutional investors to manage
          portfolio relationships and systemic risk. We built the product and
          piloted it with asset managers overseeing more than €1.5 trillion,
          including NBIM, Barings, and CCLA.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          After DeRisk, I joined <a
            href="/projects/ziggma"
            class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">Ziggma</a
          > as Co-Founder and COO — a portfolio management platform for retail
          investors that was already gaining traction. We grew it to 35,000 users and €1.5 billion in linked assets. During that
          period, I also consulted for <a
            href="/projects/impactive"
            class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">Impactive</a
          > on strategy for their institutional shareholder engagement platform.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          But here's what I kept noticing: the people around me — smart,
          well-earning professionals — had no idea what to do with their money.
          Especially the expats. The German financial system is complex, opaque,
          and overwhelmingly in German. Most advisors earn commissions, which
          means they're incentivized to sell you products, not solve your
          problems.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          I decided to change that. I became an independent, fee-based financial
          planning coach and started building <a
            href="/projects/alba-wealth"
            class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">Alba Wealth</a
          > — an AI-powered planning tool — because I believe technology can make
          good financial planning accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Today, I split my time between coaching expat clients one-on-one and
          building the tools I wish had existed when I was figuring this out
          myself.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-0">
          When I'm not working on money, I'm most likely in the ocean.
