  <!-- The Story -->
  <SectionWrapper>
    <div class="max-w-[680px] mx-auto">
      <div class="font-serif text-lg leading-[1.8] text-navy-800">
        <p class="mb-6">
          Ever since I was a teenager, I wanted to explore and understand how the world works. So it felt natural to go travel after finishing high school.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          I decided to study business and learned how finance is the system that shapes incentives, distributes power and connects economies. At the same time, I got curious about technology, because it seemed to offer an unlimited number of untapped opportunities.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          While I loved the scale of global banking in my first role, I was eager to find out if I could build something from scratch.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          In 2016, everyone was talking about how technology would disrupt industry. So I started a consulting firm to help industrial companies adopt digital technology.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          When Covid put business on hold, I returned to finance. The climate crisis was being hotly discussed in financial services, but most solutions seemed to be inefficient greenwashing. As someone who has always lived close to the ocean, the topic was personal. I got deep into corporate governance as a tool for change, first building a sustainable investing platform for institutional investors, then co-founding a portfolio management company for retail investors.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          But people didn't just lack good tools and financial literacy. There were fundamental flaws in how the financial advice industry operates, costing people their financial independence.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          This coincided with the rise of AI, opening new possibilities for how personal finance could actually work.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          That's where I am today. I run an independent financial coaching practice for internationals in Germany and Portugal, and I'm building a financial planning AI that takes care of your personal financial life.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-0">
          When I'm not working on money, I'm most likely in the ocean.
        </p>
