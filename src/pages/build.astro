        AI-native development has made it possible to build production-grade
        software at a fraction of the traditional cost and timeline. The hard
        part is no longer building. It's knowing what to build and integrating
        it operationally.

  <!-- Why This Matters Now -->

          Software used to be expensive. Now it's not.
        </h2>
        <p class="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed">
          AI-native development means a single experienced builder can ship what
          used to require a team of five. That changes the math: internal tools,
          workflow automation, customer-facing apps, and AI agents are now worth
          building for use cases that were previously too small or too niche.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">
          But you still need to build the right thing.
        </h2>
        <p class="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed">
          The bottleneck has moved. It's no longer "can we build this?" It's
          "should we build this?" That's where my experience as a product
          manager, business analyst, and venture builder comes in.

          Everyone can build fast now. The scarce skill is knowing what's worth
          building. I've spent eight years leading product at fintech startups
          and financial services companies. I scope before I build, and I'll tell
          you if something isn't worth building.

          No handoffs between a PM, designer, and developer. I hold the full

          misunderstandings and faster iteration.

          AI-generated code needs experienced review. I treat security, error
          handling, and maintainability as requirements, not afterthoughts.
          Especially important if you operate in a regulated industry.
